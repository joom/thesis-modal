\begin{abstract}
  Curry-Howard correspondence describes a language that corresponds to
  propositional logic.  If modal logic is an extension of propositional logic,
  then what language corresponds to modal logic? If there is one, then what is
  it good for?  Murphy's dissertation \cite{tom7} argues that a programming
  language designed based on modal type systems can provide elegant
  abstractions to organize local resources on different computers.  In this
  thesis, I limit his argument to simple web programming and claim that a modal
  logic based language provides a way to write readable code and correct web
  applications.  To do this, I defined and implemented a minimal language
  called MinML5 in Agda and then wrote a compiler to JavaScript for it. The
  compiler is a series of type directed translations through fully formalized
  languages, the last one of which is a very limited subset of JavaScript.

  % Background intro {{{
  In non-modal propositional logic, certain kinds of notations for inference
  rules obscure the distinction between a proposition and a judgment.
  Consider the following conjunction intro rule:
  \begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$A$}
    \AxiomC{$B$}
    \BinaryInfC{$A \land B$}
  \end{prooftree}
  Now are $A$, $B$ and $A \land B$ in this rule propositions or judgments? The
  correct answer is judgments, because what this notation means is the
  following sentence: ``$A \land B$ is true, if $A$ is true and $B$ is true.''
  The ambiguity about the notions of proposition and judgment can be removed by
  adopting a new notation for judgments; we would now write ``$A$ true'' or
  ``$\vdash A$'' for a judgment, instead of just ``$A$''.

  This notation and the inference rule above do not cover the case in which a
  proposition depends on other propositions, i.e. when we want to say ``$A$
  follows from $\Gamma$''. We accept ``$\Gamma \vdash A$'' as the default
  notation such a judgment.  If we apply these changes to our inference rules,
  we would get
  \begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash A$}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash B$}
    \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash A \land B$}
  \end{prooftree}
  The distinction between a proposition and judgment does not come up often
  when we think about non-modal logic, so this distinction might seem like a
  nuisance. However it will be our gateway to understanding our modal logic.
  \cite{judgmental}

  I think it should be clarified if an incorrect or unproved judgment is still
  a judgment. In other words, is the word judgment a way to express truth or is
  it just a form? In this regard, I will follow Martin-LÃ¶f's fourfold
  terminology \cite{pml}: judgment and proposition are ``stripped of [their]
  epistemic force'', they describe the state that those concepts have before
  ``[they have] been proved or become known''. On the other hand, the terms
  ``evident judgment'' and ``true proposition'' imply that there is a proof.

  % Modal Logic {{{
  \subsection{Modal logic}

  Modal logic is a broad field that includes various kinds of logic that deal
  with relational structures that have different perspectives of truth.
  \cite{blackburn}\cite{tom7} For our purposes, we only want to examine
  intuitionistic modal logic with explicit worlds.

  We call these perspectives of truth, ``possible worlds''. Each world holds a
  possibly different set of truths. It is possible for a proposition to be true
  in one world and false in another.

  To illustrate the concept, let's think of a prison that has as many cells as
  our worlds. Suppose in each cell, there is a person who is locked inside.
  Alice is in a cell with a window, while Bob is in a windowless one.
  Alice can look outside and learn that it is sunny today, however Bob would
  not be able to do that. In Alice's room you have proof of the nice weather,
  but in Bob's room you do not.

  Even though Alice, Bob and other in different cells, we have a warden,
  Walter, that provides communication among everyone. Alice can take a photo of
  outside and send it in an envelope to Bob through Walter. Now Bob also has a
  proof that it is sunny today, and he can use it later.

  From a modal logic perspective, it matters to regulate who can send envelopes
  to whom. If we call our set of prisoners, i.e. worlds, $W$, then this
  regulation is achieved by a relation $R \subseteq W \times W$. The pair of
  those, $\mathfrak{F} = (W,R)$ is called a frame.

  The properties of the relation $R$ defines the kind of logic we have. For our
  purposes we will only deal with the relation that is reflexive, transitive
  and symmetric, i.e. an equivalence relation. This kind of logic is called
  \textbf{IS5}.\cite{lecture15-pf}
